Using Docker, bash and bitcoin-core write a script that launches a private Bitcoin Network
(regtest) with at least 2 nodes. Pair them between each other and mine some blocks. After,
send at least one transaction from one node to the other.
Create a public Github repository where you are pushing your code as you write it.
Creating a pipeline in Github actions to run such systems is a plus but not a requirement.
